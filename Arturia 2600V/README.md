# About

The ARP 2600 is a legendary semi-modular synthesizer used by countless artists. Arturia's remake sounds fine, but the structure of the synth and its idiosyncratic behavior make patching a pretty challenging deal.

If you're looking for something that can stand in for a Pro Soloist or Odyssey - this is probably your best bet, even though it's not 100% identical.
