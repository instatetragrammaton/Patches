# Musings

I like to write, and I tend to write a lot; as a consequence, I always search for a good way to explain things succinctly.

Video is a way to do this - but not an optimal way. Here's a collection of thoughts about things so that I can link to them and don't have to explain them every time.

All of it is my opinion. 

## Why should I believe this?

Because I'm a strong believer in [drinking my own champagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). 
If I tell you that something can be achieved, I should be able to follow my own advice and end up with the desired result. If I reason about something, then this should be internally consistent.

Sure, there's also some years of experience - but years aren't authority - evidence-based advice is.
