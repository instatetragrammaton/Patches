# What's a DAW?

DAW stands for Digital Audio Workstation. It's interchangeably used for the piece of software that runs on a computer and the computer itself - since that's where the 
term [workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation) originates from. In most cases, it's used for the software - so when someone asks me what DAW I use, I say "Ableton Live" and not "My Mac M1".

A DAW has several responsibilities. It's a potential centerpiece of your setup.

Before we start, it's useful to consult the glossary which has some nice tl;dr explanations.

# Conductor

DAWs often have a MIDI sequencer. That makes a DAW a kind of [conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting) - it tells other instruments what to play, but doesn't make any music by itself.
When you play notes on a controller keyboard, those are received by the DAW; when you have a synthesizer connected, the DAW can send those notes to the synthesizer.

# Mixing desk

All audio - anything that arrives from the outside via your audio interface - ends up in the DAW. The DAW is the only piece of software allowed to talk to your audio interface.
The DAW's job is to mix this and send it back to the audio interface to your headphones or speakers.

# Patchbay

Most mixing desks also have the ability to route audio - and since doing this in software does not cost anything, there are not really any restrictions. Want to put 10 insert effects in a row? 
Sure, why not. Want 99 send effects? No problem.

# Tape recorder

In the 70s, studios had [big tape recorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitrack_recording) that could record 8 or 16 or even 24 tracks at the same time. Before this, a band had to practice their
song to perfection to record it in one or two takes - more than that would be expensive because you'd have to get everyone together. If there was a mistake, you'd have to start all over again.

With multitracking, a band could effectively slice this up. On Monday, the drummer would come in and record the drum parts. On Tuesday, the bass player would be able to hear just the drums and record the bass.
If the bass player messed up, the recording of the drums was still intact - so instead of having to throw it out completely, they could just re-record it.

A singer could already sing the lead part based on the bass + rhythm parts; no need to wait for the keyboards. Meanwhile, the keyboard and guitar players could do the same.

In that time, polyphonic synthesizers were still expensive. This means that if you wanted to play a chord on something like a [Minimoog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimoog), 
you'd have to record every melody individually - but if you have enough tracks available for just that and the patience required, it becomes possible.

The result was something you'd never be able to play as a human being - because buying 4 Minimoogs and growing two extra arms was either not possible or prohibitively expensive. The first track on 
[Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodbye_Yellow_Brick_Road) - "Funeral For A Friend" is a good example of this - all the chords you hear were recorded note by 
note on an [ARP 2500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_2500).

This way of working - of recording the entire melody for that track in one go - is one of the ways of working with a DAW. Of course, since the tape is digital, there's no end to what you can record.

# Sampler

Audio tracks in the DAW can be freely manipulated - it's possible to create small snippets and to place them where you want.

Before samplers, digital delays were used to record a piece of audio into the memory - and advanced delays allowed that piece of audio to be played back whenever you wanted. This is why a lot of [80s 
"remixes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-H2JrE1mmM) (Michael Franks - Dr. Sax) have a typical effect where a phrase gets retriggered but not pitched up or down - you're hearing a delay being used as a sampler.
