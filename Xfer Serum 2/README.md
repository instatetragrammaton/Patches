# About

Serum 2 improves on nearly everything I can think of that eventually started bothering me in version 1 - no true parallel filters, only two oscillators and a sub - 
and adds a whole bunch of new features that are again love letters to some amazing software.

The spectral oscillator clearly takes cues from the late Izotope Iris, so it's a joy to see that this has been included for further, deeper sound design.

The LFOs still only go to 100 Hz, but since there are now three oscillators, more creative FM can be achieved in that way.
