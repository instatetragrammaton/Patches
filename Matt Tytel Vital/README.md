# About

Matt Tytel is well known for [Helm](https://tytel.org/helm/) - a great free software synthesizer. 3 years in the making and released in November 2020, Vital is an incredibly powerful wavetable "supersynth" that takes all the things that made Massive and Serum great and improves yet again on them.

The interface combines both drag & drop with a modulation matrix, and programming is fluent and accurate. There is no lack of modulation sources and targets, and important targets all run at audio rates.

Backed by a strong community with lots of skilled sound designers, this is an incredibly promising plugin with a bright future.

# How to install presets

In Vital, click the hamburger menu (it looks like ☰) and choose "Open External Preset". Then, navigate to the preset you downloaded, and select it. Alternatively, choose "Browse presets" and right-click any preset, then choose "Open File Location". This shows you where presets are installed.

For Windows, it's `%userprofile%\Documents\Vital\`. If you just type `%userprofile%` in your file explorer, it'll automatically jump to `C:\Users\Your Name\` - assuming that your user folder is installed on your C drive.

You can easily create categories per user. You could create a new folder called `%userprofile%\Documents\Vital\Instatetragrammaton\Presets`. In there, you can just copy all the `.vital` files, and they'll show up in the plugin. Depending on which version you're running, you may need to re-instantiate it.
