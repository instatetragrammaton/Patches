# Do you take requests?

You can always ask nicely! 

## OK, how?

* Provide a link to the track on Youtube if it's an existing song.
* If it's a Splice sample or something like that, [Vocaroo](https://vocaroo.com) works well. Try to isolate it as much as possible.
* Include a timestamp and a description. Is it a bass sound, a lead sound, chords - if there are multiple sounds playing at once, which one can I identify?
* Don't use emotion-based descriptors like "melancholic". Thing is - everyone perceives sounds and contexts differently and it doesn't really help me identify which sound you're talking about

Since you already know which sound you're thinking of/talking about and I can't read minds, you'll need to be complete and precise in what you are looking for. This is the easiest way to get an answer.

Asking "is it a preset" or "is it a sample" is kind of futile. This only works when you're talking about well-known sounds, such as the [Korg M1's piano](https://www.synthmania.com/m1.htm). Omnisphere alone has over 9000 presets in the factory set so it's impossible to memorize them all, even if someone just used those straight in a mix.

"Is it a sample" is a strange question; even if it is, a service like Splice has millions of samples available, and if 9000 Omnisphere presets are impossible to memorize, then all those Splice samples are even more impossible to memorize.

Then, ask your question on reddit on [r/synthrecipes](https://reddit.com/r/synthrecipes/) or [r/synthesizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/) . If you're not getting any replies, [send me a message via the chat](https://www.reddit.com/user/Instatetragrammaton/).

## That sounds like a lot of work!

That's fair.

The first reason is simple. I'm not the only person who knows how to create/recreate sounds - there are several people who know. Don't ask just one person - ask an entire community. You might get your answer faster :)

The second reason is that out of all people, 99% of them need to ask. 1% are willing or capable of answering.

Other people who are smarter than I am [have turned this into a paid service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auLu8T5s3Ng) which means they get fewer requests, and they get actually something back for their time.

## What if I pay you?

I have no interest doing this professionally, because I already have a full time job. If I have any time left, it's in the weekend, and even that is vanishingly small. I already have a backlog of people who have asked and who I haven't answered yet.

_I do this for free, for fun, as time permits, and on my schedule_. No guarantees, no demands. That said, I'm not going to be offended for asking me or reminding me - since you can always ask nicely.
