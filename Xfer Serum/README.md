# Samples

Serum has a noise oscillator which can load and play back arbitrary samples. Patches that require samples that are not in the factory set can be found as follows:

* go to Menu
* choose "Show Serum Presets Folder"
* navigate to "Noises"
* navigate to "User"
* copy the .wav file in this folder

If you don't have the "User" folder - just create one! When you restart Serum, it'll show up like the others.

# About

Serum is a great software synthesizer. It has arguably paved the way for a set of wavetable "supersynthesizers" - based on wavetables,
with a semi-modular approach, and with great versatility, often uniting several methods of synthesis under one system.

It incorporates several aspects of plugins that came before, such as Native Instruments' Massive - with the drag & drop modulation system.
From Native Instruments Absynth it also took inspiration, with the spectral editing of waveforms, the ability to build waveshapes by
means of drawing, summing harmonics, or importing samples. 

The ability to load custom wavetables is one important factor that sets it apart from Massive; and this has also been a benchmark for other
plugins that were released since.
