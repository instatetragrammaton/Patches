# About

I've been using Ableton Live since version 5 - back in 2006 I bought it because I was getting really fed up with Cubase. I haven't looked back since. 
I'm currently running version 10 Suite and soon, 11 will be out.

The Synth Rack presets contain instruments and effects available in Ableton Suite, but no 3rd party plugins or (paid) Max 4 Live devices. I figured that if I'm creating Operator presets, I might as well try to branch out a bit.
