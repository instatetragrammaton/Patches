# About

Diva was released back in 2011. It has some revolutionary technology - zero-delay feedback filters.
It is still one of the best-sounding software synthesizers in existence and manages to sound properly analog;
perhaps not as perfect as a completely dedicated simulation - but what a deal! 

You're getting the following emulations:

* Moog Minimoog
* Roland Jupiter-8 / Juno-60
* Korg MS-20

and a JP8000 oscillator model with the ubiquitous supersaw, and an Oberheim-style filter.

If you had to buy these as individual plugins you'd pay three times as much.

Since Diva has solidified in terms of code and sound, you should be able to load these patches in older revisions too.
